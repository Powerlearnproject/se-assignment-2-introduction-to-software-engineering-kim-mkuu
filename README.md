Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering entails using engineering principal to design, create, deploy and maintaining software systems. This ensures software application meet user standards whilst adhering to standard and best practices. In contrast programming refers to the process by which humans give instructions to computers. The instructions are known as code. There are various programming languages that may be used to code depending on the use case. Foe example HTML and css are used for creating web pages.
So, while programming is centred around the code, software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasising a structured and methodical approach to software development.
Programming is all about coding to make the computer perform a specific task. Software engineering on the hand majors on the softwares life cycle,from product’s conceptualization to deployment and also maintenance. Programming is one off the skills of a software engineer.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
The software development cycle entails different well-defined processes, that all contribute to the complete and successful development, deployment and maintenance of a software. The processes are:
Planning:
This process entails outlinig the software’s purpose, scope and goals that is what will it help the users achieve. It also entails creating a project plan and stating clearly the software requirement specifications. To achieve this a feasibility study is conducted to evaluate financial and technical aspects.
Requirements Analysis:
Identifying and precisely recording the clientele requirements. To achieve this data may be obtained through interviews,surveys or questionnaires.
Design:
Specification on the software architecture, elements and details of excecution. Algorithms, data structures and interfaces are specified in this phase.
Development (Coding):
Code is written using the specified design following the best practices and standard procedures.
Testing:
This phase aims to ensure that everything is working as expected. Unit, integration and system testing are carried out to ensure so.
Deployment:
Software is deployed to staging environments or production. Also entails databases and servers configuration.
Maintenance:
Address bug fixes, updates, and enhancements post-deployment.
These phases ensure efficient software development, meeting user needs and business objectives
These steps make sure that user expectations and business targets are achieved while also catering for efficient software deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile model is a continuous iterative, flexible and interactive approach to software development focusing on constant improvement and customer satisfaction by improvements throughout the development.

Waterfall model is structured in a linear and sequential manner, meaning that one step of development has to be completed for the next step to occur. Each steps has specific targets to be achieved and review processes. No step overlap or iterate.

The differences between the Agile and Waterfall models of software development:
Agile is iterative and incremental allowing for flexibility and adaptability. In contrast waterfall is linear and follows a specified sequence, allows no flexibility.
Agile allows client involvement and feedback that affects adjustment and development process. Waterfall on the other hand has very minimal to no client feedback, changes are rarely made after moving to the next phase.
Agile development have short development cycle hence a faster delivery time whereas waterfall have longer delivery time since a project must be completed before deployment.

Scenarios that each model may be used
Agile models are suitable for flexible projects with evolving targets like web applications. Waterfall models are suitable for structured  projects with clearly defined goals maybe appropriate for financial or healthcare systems.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering is the process that ensure customer needs and business goals are met simultaneously. It entails identifying, analysing, specifying and validating the targets and expectations of the clientele and business taking while also managing requirements and constraints that dictate the successfulness of software development.
This process is important because it helps on clearly identifying and understanding the deliverables while also aiding communication between the clientele and the developers.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is the breaking down of a system in smaller self reliant pats or modules. Each module performs a specified task while interacting with the other through a specified interface.
It improves scalability since a new feature or improvement may be added by replacing or extending modules. 
Changes are localised hence it is easier to debug and perform updates thus improving maintainability.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing - This is testing done at the code level, it test of individual components of the software checking their functionality. It is done to ensure that each unit works properly on it’s own in isolation.
Integration testing - This the testing done to ensure that each module works together seamlessly. It is carried out to ensure module communication, data flow and validate interfaces.
System testing - This level of testings is done to check the entire application integration. It is conducted in an environment similar to production environment checking to see if the software system meets the business targets. 
Acceptance testing - This is the final level of testing that determines if the software will be put to production. It is done to ensure the software meets the business expectations and satisfies customer needs. Testing done at the developer site is called alpha testing and the one done by end users at the end user site is called beta testing.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control system are software that track and manage changes done to code. 
Version controls systems are important since they store the code and changes made making it easier for retrieval and also ensures code integrity. It also allows developers to work concurrently on the same project aiding collaboration.
An example is Git
Compatibility:It is compatible with all operating systems and can access code from other version control systems.
Facilities collaboration: Allows developers to work on projects from every place in the world. Each developer has a a copy al the progressive changes made and all also allows code synchronisation from the developers.
Code branching: It make it easy to create manage and track branches. Multiple branches can be created and coexist easily, the can also be merged or rebased.
Scalability: Can handle projects of any size and seamlessly manages backups and project scaling.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software projet manager role is to ensure successful software development. They leverage communication, leadership skills, technical ability and experience to make sure the developers create exactly what the customer requires.They Manage collaborations, estimate project scope and constraints  and communicate any changes that may develop to participating parties while ensuring the system meets standards and requirements.

Challenges Faced in Managing Projects
Scope creep - Occurs when project exceed expected the agreed upon targets. Is Caused by the clientele not having well defined goals. May be prevented by having a very clear documented project scope.
Changing technologies - This might make project features obsolete or uncompetitive. May be combated by planning for technological transitions and upgrading of skills.
Poor morale from team members. This might be addressed recognition and acknowledging team and individual efforts. Having a positive work environment is also boosts morale.
Meeting strict deadlines - this may be taken care of by setting of realistic deadlines and doing frequent check-ins with both the developers team and the stakeholders to monitor progress.
Quality control - this may be mitigated by regularly evaluating project quality and setting up quality assurance processes.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
This is the process of enhancing and managing software by changing, modifying and updating the software to cater for customer needs after initial deployment and development.
Corrective maintenance - is done to correct errors and bugs in the software. It also aims to find any unnoticed faults during development like design flows, performance issues and security vulnerabilities.
Adaptive maintenance - this involves modifying the software to work in new or different environment. May be done to allow for changes in hardware , operating system, external interfaces, government policies and business rules.
Perfective maintenance - done to improve performance ,add new features and to improve changeability. Performed by code optimization, usability improvement and adding functionality based on users feedback.
Preventive maintenance - entails taking measles to ensure that no problems don’t occur in future. Done by performing regular system checks, system optimization, updating documentation, detecting memory leaks to ensure long-term  stability.

Software maintenance ensures system reliability and stability and is compatible and adaptable to other technologies.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Unethical data collection - developers should handle data responsibly and also differentiate between balancing data for functionality without breaching users privacy .
Algorithmic bias - developers should make sure the data used to train models should not produce discriminatory or biassed outcomes.
Weak security - developers should prioritise vigorous security measures in order to avaid data leaks, breaches and vulnerabilities. 

 How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 
In the article titled “How can software engineers be ethical?” by Lyndsey Scott, the author emphasizes the importance of clear code in promoting ethical behavior. When dealing with decisions or logic related to personal data, writing code that is transparent and purposeful creates accountability. A clear trail of how the work was implemented ensures there is no ambiguity in how the result was derived.
